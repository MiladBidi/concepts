Overview
This guide covers setting up an OpenVPN server to:
Connect to an internal network (e.g., 10.20.20.0/24).

Optionally route all internet traffic through the VPN.

Understand the flow of packets, NAT, and routing in a VPN setup.

The server has two interfaces:

ens192: Internal network (10.20.20.22/24).
ens224: Public internet (70.50.50.30/29).
The VPN tunnel uses the 10.8.0.0/24 range, with the server at 10.8.0.1 and clients (e.g., laptop) at 10.8.0.6.
